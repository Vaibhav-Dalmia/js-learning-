# ðŸ“… Day 7 â€“ Transitioning from JavaScript to HTML

## âœ… What I Did Today:
- Paused JavaScript after 6 days of consistent learning
- Began learning **HTML basics** to understand how web pages are structured
- Started watching CodeWithHarry's HTML series

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Covering in HTML:
- Basic structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Common tags: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<button>`, etc.
- How content is displayed in browsers

## ðŸŽ¯ Why the Shift:
- To understand how JavaScript connects to the web through the DOM
- Preparing to build full interactive projects (HTML + CSS + JS)
