ðŸš€ Day 1 of My Blockchain Dev Journey

Today I officially began my journey into coding and blockchain development!

âœ… Learned the basics of JavaScript
âœ… Understood what variables are and how to use let, var, and const
âœ… Got my hands dirty with simple examples in the console
âœ… Felt excited and a little overwhelmed â€” but thatâ€™s part of the process!

Starting from 0 in coding, but I have full knowledge of how crypto, NFTs, tokens, and minting work.
Excited to build skills step by step and eventually develop real Web3 applications.

Letâ€™s go! ðŸ’»âš¡
